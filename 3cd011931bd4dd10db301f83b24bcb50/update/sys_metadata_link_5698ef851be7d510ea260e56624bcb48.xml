        <notes>Phone data shows several calls made by MP to 07950527600 on the 18th August.

I have called the number 07950527600 which was answered by Jane Doe - cleaning company.
She states they clean the Edward street apartments and the MP has been contacting them regarding his journal which was left in the room. The journal is currently with police. Jane has not told the MP that police have it.

The MP did not state where he was currently living and that he was close by.

I have asked if possible if she would agree to message the MP and that to come to the flats regarding the journal, and that police would attend instead.

I have explained that the MP is not in trouble and it is just to check he is safe and well.

She will speak to her manager to see if she assist us.</notes>
